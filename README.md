# What is JDBC?
### JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity, which is a standard Java API for databaseindependent connectivity between the Java programming language, and a wide range of databases.
 Making a connection to a database.
 Creating SQL or MySQL statements.
 Executing SQL or MySQL queries in the database.
 Viewing & Modifying the resulting records.
### Fundamentally, JDBC is a specification that provides a complete set of interfaces that allows for portable access to an underlying database. Java can be used to write different types of executables, such as:
 Java Applications
 Java Applets
 Java Servlets
 Java ServerPages (JSPs)
 Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs).
### All of these different executables are able to use a JDBC driver to access a database, and take advantage of the stored data.JDBC provides the same capabilities as ODBC, allowing Java programs to contain databaseindependent code.
### Before moving further, you need to have a good understanding of the following two subjects:
 Core JAVA Programming
 SQL or MySQL Database
 JDBC API: This provides the application-to-JDBC Manager connection.
 JDBC Driver API: This supports the JDBC Manager-to-Driver Connection.
